/**
 * Defines an input interface.
 *
 * Input plugin allows user to listen to the input devices, but it
 * is not intended to work with the input hardware. The input hardware processing
 * is delegated to the input providers, which should be implemented as a separate
 * plugins.
 * Input providers create logical input devices. For example, a window may have a keyboard and mouse associated
 * with it, i.e. a physical keyboard state may be different from a logical
 * keyboard associated with a window, due to some physical key state changes
 * being sent to a different window.
 *
 * Everything to be used by input providers is put into the InputProvider struct in the separate file.
 * All the functions from Input.h is meant to be used by input consumers (end user).
 *
 * User can subscribe to the device events, as well as device connection events,
 * and upon subscribing to device connection events, user immediately receives
 * "connect" notifications for all already present events of the kind. Similar is
 * true for unsubscribing - user will immediately get "disconnect" notifications
 * for all still present events.
 *
 * One notable feature of device handling is that there is no logical difference
 * between a button(key) and an axis: both can be either polled by value, producing
 * floating-point value, or by button flags, which allow to treat analog inputs
 * as buttons (one example is treat gamepad stick as discrete d-pad).
 *
 * The plugins also allows to map actions to device inputs, allowing to
 * set up multiple slots per action mapping. Those actions could be polled in
 * a similar manner (i.e. by value or as button flags).
