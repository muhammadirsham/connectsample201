     *  This is the underlying kernel sound system as well as an array of plugins.
     *  Some users may use ALSA so they can use the JACK plugin for professional
     *  audio applications.
     *  Some users also prefer to use the `dmix` and `dsnoop` sound servers
     *  instead of Pulse Audio.
     *  ALSA is not user-friendly, so the following issues may appear:
     *   - ALSA devices are sensitive to latency because, for the most part,
     *     they use a fixed-size ring buffer, so it is possible to get audio
     *     underruns or overruns on a heavily loaded system or a device
     *     configured with an extremely small buffer.
     *   - Some ALSA devices are exclusive access, so there is no guaranteed that
     *     they will open properly.
     *   - Multiple configurations of each physical device show up as a separate
     *     audio device, so a system with two audio devices will have ~40 ALSA
     *     devices.
     *   - Opening an ALSA device can take hundreds of milliseconds.
     *     Combined with the huge device count, this can mean that manually
     *     enumerating all devices on the system can take several seconds.
     *   - Some versions of libasound will automatically create devices with
     *     invalid configurations, such as `dmix` devices that are flagged as
     *     supporting playback and capture but will fail to open for capture.
     *   - ALSA devices can be configured with some formats that carb.audio
     *     does not support, such as big endian formats, ULAW or 64 bit float.
     *     Users should use a `plug` (format conversion) plugin for ALSA if they
     *     need to use a device that requires a format such as this.
