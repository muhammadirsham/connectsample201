     *  voice chat); additionally, the Ogg container combines Vorbis blocks
     *  into chunks that can be seconds long.
     *  libvorbis will accept frame rates of 1Hz - 200KHz (Note that IAudioPlayback
     *  does not supports framerates below @ref kMinFrameRate).
     *  Vorbis is able to handle up to 255 channels, but sounds with more than 8
     *  channels have no official ordering. (Note that does not support more than @ref kMaxChannels)
     *
     *  Vorbis has a defined channel mapping for audio with 1-8 channels.
     *  Channel counts 3 and 5 have an incompatible speaker layout with the

     *  A 3 channel layout uses @ref kSpeakerModeThreePointZero,

    /** The Opus codec.
     *  This is a lossy codec that is designed to be suitable for almost any
     *  application.
     *  Opus can encode very high quality lossy audio, similarly to @ref
     *  SampleFormat::eVorbis.
     *  Opus can encode very low bitrate audio at a much higher quality than
     *  @ref SampleFormat::eVorbis.
     *  Opus also offers much lower bitrates than @ref SampleFormat::eVorbis.
     *  Opus is designed for low latency usage, with a minimum latency of 5ms
     *  and a block size configurable between 2.5ms and 60ms.
     *  Opus also offers forward error correction to handle packet loss during
     *  transmission.
     *
     *  Opus is stored in Ogg file containers (.ogg or .oga), but in use cases
     *  such as network transmission, Ogg containers are not necessary.
     *  Opus only supports sample rates of 48000Hz, 24000Hz, 16000Hz, 12000Hz and 8000Hz.
     *  Passing unsupported frame rates below 48KHz to the encoder will result
     *  in the input audio being resampled to the next highest supported frame
     *  rate.
     *  Passing frame rates above 48KHz to the encoder will result in the input
     *  audio being resampled down to 48KHz.
     *  The 'Opus Custom' format, which removes this frame rate restriction, is
     *  not supported.
     *
     *  Opus has a defined channel mapping for audio with 1-8 channels.
     *  The channel mapping is identical to that of @ref SampleFormat::eVorbis.
     *  For streams with more than 8 channels, the mapping is undefined and
     *  must be determined by the application.
     *  Up to 255 audio channels are supported.
     *
     *  Opus has three modes of operation: a linear predictive coding (LPC)
     *  mode, a modified discrete cosine transform (MCDT) mode and a hybrid
     *  mode which combines both the LPC and MCDT mode.
     *  The LPC mode is optimized to encode voice data at low bitrates and has
     *  the ability to use forward error correction and packet loss compensation.
     *  The MCDT mode is suitable for general purpose audio and is optimized
     *  for minimal latency.
     *
     *  Because Opus uses a fixed number of frames per block, additional
     *  padding will be added when encoding with a @ref CodecState, unless the
     *  frame size is specified in advance with @ref OpusEncoderSettings::frames.
     *
     *  These are the results of decoding speed tests run on Opus; they are
     *  shown as the decoding time relative to decoding a 16 bit uncompressed
     *  WAVE file to @ref SampleFormat::ePcm32. Clip 1 and 2 are stereo music.
     *  Clip 3 is a mono voice recording.  Clip 1 has low inter-channel
     *  correlation; Clip 2 has high inter-channel correlation.
     *  Note that the bitrates listed here are approximate, since Opus is
     *  variable bitrate.

     *  This is currently supported for decoding only; to compress audio with a
     *  lossy algorithm, @ref SampleFormat::eVorbis or @ref SampleFormat::eOpus
     *  should be used.
     *
     *  The MP3 decoder currently only has experimental support for seeking;
     *  files encoded by LAME seem to seek with frame-accurate precision, but
     *  results may vary on other encoders.
     *  It is recommended to load the file with @ref fDataFlagDecode,
     *  if you intend to use frame-accurate loops.
     *
     *  MP3 is faster to decode than @ref SampleFormat::eVorbis and @ref
     *  SampleFormat::eOpus.
     *  This is particularly noticeable because MP3's decoding speed is not
     *  affected as significantly by increasing bitrates as @ref
     *  SampleFormat::eVorbis and @ref SampleFormat::eOpus.
     *  The quality degradation of MP3 with low bitrates is much more severe
     *  than with @ref SampleFormat::eVorbis and @ref SampleFormat::eOpus, so
     *  this difference in performance is not as severe as it may appear.
     *  The following are the times needed to decode a sample file that is
