 *  opened when the next event is queued with @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocEvent().

     *           operation will effectively be ignored for schemas that were not registered
     *           using the @ref omni::structuredlog::fSchemaFlagKeepLogOpen schema flag since those schemas will
     *           not leave their logs open.  The named log files will only remain closed until
     *           the next attempt to write an event message to it.  It is the responsibility
     *           of the host app to ensure no events are written to the effected log file(s)
     *           for the duration that the log needs to remain closed.
     *
     *  @note This call itself is thread safe.  However the log file may be reopened if a
     *        pending event is processed in the event queue or a new event is sent while
     *        the calling thread expects the log to remain closed.  It is the caller's
     *        responsibility to either stop the event queue, disable structured logging, or
     *        prevent other events from being sent while the log(s) need to remain closed.

     *           processing thread and flush all pending event messages to the log.  The
     *           processing system will be restarted when the next
     *           @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocEvent()
     *           call is made to attempt to send a new message.  This call is useful if the
     *           structured log plugin needs to be unloaded.  If the processing thread is left
     *           running, it will prevent the plugin from being unloaded (or even being attempted
     *           to be unloaded).  This can also be used to temporarily disable the structured
     *           log system if its not needed or wanted.  If the structured log system needs to
     *           be disabled completely, a call to @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::setEnabled()
