/**
 * Defines boiler-plate code to declare the plugin's interfaces and registration code.
 *
 * Rather than directly calling this macro, consider calling @ref CARB_PLUGIN_IMPL which calls this macro for you.
 *
 * This macro does the following:
 *
 *  - Defines `carbGetFrameworkVersion` and `carbOnPluginRegisterEx2` functions.
 *
 *  - Sets the @ref g_carbFramework variable so @ref carb::getFramework() works.
 *
 *  - Sets the plugin client variable: @ref g_carbClientName.  The client name is used by @ref carb::Framework to
 *    create a graph of client inter-dependencies.
 *
 *  - Advertises to @ref carb::Framework the interfaces implemented by this plugin.
 *
 *  - Enables the usage of ONI (see @oni_overview) in the plugin.
 *
 * This macro must be defined in the global namespace.
 *
 * @param impl The PluginImplDesc constant to be used as plugin description.
 *
 * @param ... One or more interface types to be implemented by the plugin. An interface is a `struct` with
 * a call to @ref CARB_PLUGIN_INTERFACE() inside it. These interface types are constructed during plugin registration
 * (prior to the plugin startup) and destructed immediately after plugin shutdown. A global fillInterface() function
 * must exist and will be called immediately after instantiating the interface type. The interface types need not be
 * trivially constructed or destructed, but their constructors and destructors MUST NOT use any Carbonite framework
 * functions.

 * be called if \ref carb::Framework::unloadAllPlugins is called, but *not* if
 * \ref carb::quickReleaseFrameworkAndTerminate is called. This serves as a guide for plugin authors.
 *
 * This function is mutually exclusive with \ref carbOnPluginQuickShutdown; either this function or that one is called
 * depending on the shutdown type.
 *
 * Providing this function is completely optional.
 *
 * Generally, this function should be provided if \ref carbOnPluginStartup or \ref carbOnPluginStartupEx is provided in
 * order to clean up the work done in the startup function.
 *
 * Any interfaces declared as a dependency in \ref CARB_PLUGIN_IMPL_DEPS will still be available to this plugin when
 * this function is called.
 *
 * \warning This function should not attempt to acquire any interfaces that the plugin has not previously acquired.
 * In other words, only use interfaces in this function that the plugin has already acquired.
 *
 * During shutdown, if a circular reference exists between interfaces acquired by this plugin and those interfaces
 * (possibly indirectly) acquiring interfaces from this plugin, then it is possible that interfaces acquired by this
 * plugin may already be shut down. Using \ref carb::getCachedInterface or \ref carb::Framework::tryAcquireInterface may
 * result in an error log being issued. In this case, \ref carb::Framework::tryAcquireExistingInterface will only
 * acquire the interface if the plugin providing it is still started.
 *
 * Once this function returns successfully, the Framework considers your plugin as shut down and will typically proceed
 * to unload the library.
 *
 * Typical things this function might do:
 * - Deallocate memory and data structures for your plugin
 * - Report on leaked objects
 * - Shut down libraries and subsystems
 *
 * The type of this function is \ref carb::OnPluginShutdownFn and named \ref kCarbOnPluginShutdownFnName.
