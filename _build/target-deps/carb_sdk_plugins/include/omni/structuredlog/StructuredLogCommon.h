/** Helper macro to piece together a unique event name to generate an ID from.
 *
 *  @param schemaName       The name of the schema that the event belongs to.  This should be
 *                          the name from the schema's "#/schemaMeta/clientName" property.
 *                          This value must be a string literal.
 *  @param eventName        The full name of the event that the ID is being generated for.
 *                          This should be the name of one of the objects in the
 *                          "#/definitions/events/" listing.  This value must be a string
 *                          literal.
 *  @param schemaVersion    The version of the schema the event belongs to.  This should be
 *                          the value from the schema's "#/schemaMeta/schemaVersion" property.
 *                          This value must be a string literal.
 *  @param parserVersion    The version of the object parser that this event ID is being built
 *                          for.  This should be the value of kParserVersion expressed as
 *                          a string.  This value must be a string literal.
 *  @returns A string representing the full name of an event.  This string is suitable for passing
 *           to OMNI_STRUCTURED_LOG_EVENT_ID() to generate a unique event ID from.

/** Sets that a schema should be registered on module load.
 *
 *  @param schemaType_  The name and fully qualified namespace of the generated schema class
 *                      to be registered.  This will be added to a list of schemas to be
 *                      registered when the module is initialized.
 *  @param schemaName_  The name of the schema to be registered.  This may be any valid C++
 *                      token string, but should reflect the schema's name.  This is used
 *                      to make the initialization symbol more unique to the generated schema
 *                      class.
 *  @param version_     The schema's version expressed as a C++ token.  This should replace
 *                      any dots ("."), dashes ("-"), colons (":"), whitespace (" "), or
 *                      commas (",") with an underscore ("_").  This is used to make the
 *                      initialization symbol more unique to the generated schema class.
 *  @param parser_      The parser version being used for the generated schema expressed as
 *                      a C++ token.  This should replace any dots ("."), dashes ("-"), colons
 *                      (":"), whitespace (" "), or commas (",") with an underscore ("_").
 *                      This is used to make the initialization symbol more unique to the
 *                      generated schema class.
 *  @returns No return value.
 *
 *  @remarks This creates and registers a helper function that will call into a generated
 *           schema's registerSchema() function during omni core or framework initialization.
 *           The symbol used to force the registration at C++ initialization time is named
 *           based on the schema's name, schema's version, parser version, and the line number
 *           in the header file that this call appears on.  All of these values are used to
 *           differentiate this schema's registration from that of all others, even for
 *           different versions of the same generated schema.
