/** @file
 *  @brief Helper header to be able to use the `omni.structuredlog.plugin` plugin in a standalone
 *         mode.  When using this mode, the rest of the Carbonite framework is not necessary.
 *         Only the single module `omni.structuredlog.plugin` library will be needed.  The main
 *         feature of this header is the `omni::structuredlog::StructuredLogStandalone` helper
 *         class.  This manages loading the structured log library, registers all schemas for
 *         the calling module, and allows access to the supported structured log interfaces.
 *
 *  @note In order to use the structured logging system in standalone mode, this header must
 *        be included instead of any other structured log headers.  This header will pull in
 *        all other structured log interface headers that are supported in standalone mode.
 *        Other structured log headers are neither guaranteed to compile nor function as
 *        expected in a non-Carbonite app.
 *
 *  @note It is left up to the host app to handle launching the telemetry transmitter app
 *        if that is needed.  When used in standalone mode in a non-Carbonite app, this header
 *        is only intended to provide the functionality for emitting log messages.  The host
 *        app can either rely on another external Omniverse app to launch the transmitter for
 *        it, or launch it manually if needed.

/** Helper class to provide structured log functionality in non-Carbonite based apps.  This
 *  provides loading and shutdown functionality for the library and also allows for some
 *  common setup in one easy call.  This class is intended to be able to gracefully fail
 *  if the structured log plugin isn't available or couldn't be loaded for any reason.
 *  As long as the init() method returns `true`, it can be assumed that all functionality
 *  and features are present and available.
 *
 *  Once initialized, this object doesn't necessarily need to be interacted with directly
 *  any further.  As long as the object exists, the structured log functionality is available.
 *  Once this object is destroyed however, the structured log functionality cannot be
 *  guaranteed to be available any more.  It is intended for this object to be instantiated
 *  and initialized in main() or at the global scope in the process' main module.  It can
 *  also be used from other libraries if they want to integrate structured logging as well.
 *  Only a single instance of this object should be necessary.
 *
 *  Before any structured logging features can be used, the object must be initialized
 *  with init().  This allows the log path and the default log filename to be specified
 *  and will also load the library and register all the schemas for the calling module.
 *  Note that if no schemas are registered, no log messages will be emitted, the calls
 *  will just be silently ignored.  If modules other than the process' main module also
 *  have schemas to be registered, they can either call registerSchemas() from this
 *  class (from the process's single instantiation) or they can make a call into
 *  `omni::structuredlog::addModulesSchemas()` from within the other modules.  It is
 *  safe to call those functions even if no schemas are used in a module or if the
 *  structured log system has not been initialized yet.  If either are called before
 *  the structured log system has been initialzied, an attempt will be made to load
 *  the library first.
 *
 *  @note On Windows it is expected that this object be instantiated in the process'
 *        main module.  If it is instantiated from a DLL it will not be guaranteed
 *        that all pending log messages will be flushed to disk before the process
 *        exits.  If intantiating this from a DLL is unavoidable, it is the app's
 *        responsibility to call flush() before shutdown to ensure all messages have
 *        been flushed to disk.
 *
 *        This requirement is caused by the way that Windows processes shutdown and
 *        is unfortunately not possible to work around.  When exiting the process
 *        by returning from main(), the CRT is shutdown completely before any DLLs
 *        get a chance to do any kind of cleanup task, and ntdll will kill all threads
 *        except the exiting one.  This means that there is a possibility that attempting
 *        to flush the queue could result in a deadlock.  Further, if any cleanup code
 *        tries to use a win32 locking primitive (ie: SRW lock, critical section, etc)
 *        the process may just be terminated immediately even in the middle of cleanup.
