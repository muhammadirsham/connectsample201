 *  the symbol.  This is useful for ensuring that debug-only or initializer-only symbols
 *  do not get unintentionally eliminated from the module they are present in.
 *
 *  Note that since this does not have any data members, it shouldn't occupy any space in the
 *  module's data section.  It will however generate a C++ static initializer and shutdown
 *  destructor.

/** Helper to force a symbol to be linked.
 *
 *  @param[in] symbol_  The symbol that must be linked to the calling module.  This must be a
 *                      valid symbol name including any required namespaces given the calling
 *                      location.
 *  @param[in] tag_     A single token name to give to the symbol that forces the linking.
 *                      This is used purely for debugging purposes to give an identifiable name
 *                      to the symbol that is used to force linking of @p symbol_.  This must
 *                      be a valid C++ single token name (ie: only contains [A-Za-z0-9_] and
 *                      must not start with a number).
 *  @returns No return value.
 *
 *  @remarks This is used to ensure an unused symbol is linked into a module.  This is done
 *           by tricking the linker into thinking the symbol is not discardable because its
 *           address is being passed to a function in another module.  This is useful for
 *           example to ensure symbols that are meant purely for debugger use are not discarded
 *           from the module.  Similarly, it can be used on symbols that are only meant to
 *           anchor C++ object initializers but are unreferenced otherwise.
