/** prototype for a device change callback function.
 *
 *  @param[in] context  the context object that triggered the callback.
 *  @param[in] userData the user data value that was registered with the callback when the
 *                      context object was created.
 *  @returns no return value.
 *
 *  @remarks This callback will be performed any time an audio capture device changes its
 *           connection state.  This includes when a device is connected to or disconnected
 *           from the system, or when the system's default capture device changes.
 *
 *  @remarks Only the fact that a change occurred will be implied with this callback.  It will
 *           not deliver specific information about the device or devices that changed (it could
 *           be many or just one).  It is the callback's responsibility to re-discover the
 *           device list information and decide what if anything should be done about the
 *           change.  The changed device is not reported due to the inherently asynchronous
 *           nature of device change notifications - once the callback decides to collect
 *           information about a device it may have already changed again.
 *
 *  @note The callback will always be performed in the context of the thread that calls into
 *        the update() function.  It is the callback's responsibility to ensure that any shared
 *        resources are accessed in a thread safe manner.

     *           millisecond buffer should suffice for streaming applications.  A delay greater
     *           than 100ms between when audio is produced and heard will be noticeable to the
     *           human ear.
     *
     *  @note If this fails, the state of the context may be reset.  This must succeed before
     *        any capture operation can be started with captureStart().  All efforts will be
     *        made to keep the previous source valid in as many failure cases as possible, but
     *        this cannot always be guaranteed.  If the call fails, the isSourceValid() call can
     *        be used to check whether a capture is still possible without having to call
     *        setSource() again.
     *
     *  @note If this succeeds (or fails in non-recoverable ways mentioned above), the context's
     *        state will have been reset.  This means that any previously captured data will be

     *  @remarks This provides a means to read the captured audio data as a 'stream'.  This

     *           current cursor position up to either as much data will fit in the buffer or
     *           is currently available to immediately read.
     *
     *  @remarks This may be called with a nullptr buffer and 0 buffer length if only the number
     *           of available frames of data is needed.  This call method may be used to determine
     *           the size of the buffer to pass in or to ensure the buffer is large enough.  No
     *           actual data will be read and the next call with a non-nullptr buffer will be the
     *           one to consume the data.  Note that if audio data is still being captured, the
     *           number of available frames of data may increase between two consecutive calls.
     *           This is fine as only the number of frames that will fit in the output buffer
     *           will be consumed and any extra frames that were captured in the meantime can be
     *           consumed on the next call.  The calcReadBufferSize() function may be used to
     *           help calculate the required buffer size in bytes from the available frame count.
     *
     *  @note It is the caller's responsibility to call this frequently enough that the capture
     *        cursor on a looping buffer will not write over the data that has been read so far.
     *        If the capture cursor passes over the read cursor (ie: the last point that the data
     *        had been read up to), some corruption in the data may occur when it is finally read
     *        again.  Data should be read from the buffer with a period of at most half the length
     *        of time required to fill the capture buffer.
     *
     *  @note When this method of reading the captured data is used, it's not necessary to lock
     *        and unlock regions of the buffer.  While using this read method may be easier, it
     *        may end up being less efficient in certain applications because it may incur some
     *        extra processing overhead per call that can be avoided with the use of lock(),
     *        unlock(), and getCaptureCursor().  Also, using this method cannot guarantee that
     *        the data will be delivered in uniformly sized chunks.
     *
     *  @note The buffer length and read count must be specified in frames here, otherwise there
     *        is no accurate means of identifying how much data will fit in the buffer and how
     *        much data was actually read.
