// ********************************* IStructuredLog interface *************************************
/** Main structured log interface.  This should be treated internally as a global singleton.  Any
 *  attempt to create or acquire this interface will return the same object just with a new
 *  reference taken on it.
 *
 *  There are three main steps to using this interface:
 *    * Set up the interface.  For most app's usage, all of the default settings will suffice.
 *      The default log path will point to the Omniverse logs folder and the default user ID
 *      will be the one read from the current user's privacy settings file (if it exists).  If
 *      the default values for these is not sufficient, a new user ID should be set with
 *      @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLogSettings::setUserId() and a log output path should be set with
 *      @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLogSettings::setLogOutputPath().
 *      If the privacy settings file is not present,
 *      the user name will default to a random number.  The other defaults should be sufficient
 *      for most apps.  This setup only needs to be performed once by the host app if at all.
 *      The @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLogSettings interface can be acquired either
 *      by casting an @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog
 *      object to that type or by directly creating the @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLogSettings
 *      object using omni::core::ITypeFactory_abi::createType().
 *    * Register one or more event schemas.
 *      This is done with @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocSchema() and
 *      @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::commitSchema().
 *      At least one event must be registered for any events to
 *      be processed.  Once a schema has been registered, it will remain valid until the
 *      structured log module is unloaded from the process.  There is no way to forcibly
 *      unregister a set of events once registered.
 *    * Send zero or more events.  This is done with the @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocEvent() and
 *      @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::commitEvent() functions.
 *
 *  For the most part, the use of this interface will be dealt with in generated code.  This
 *  generated code will come from the 'omni.structuredlog' tool in the form of an inlined header
 *  file.  It is the host app's responsibility to call the header's schema registration helper
 *  function at some point on startup before any event helper functions are called.
 *
 *  All messages generated by this structured log system will be CloudEvents v1.0 compliant.
 *  These should be parseable by any tool that is capable of understanding CloudEvents.
 *
 *  Before an event can be sent, at least one schema describing at least one event must be
 *  registered.  This is done with the @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocSchema() and
 *  @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::commitSchema() functions.
 *  The @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocSchema() function returns
 *  a handle to a block of memory owned by the structured log system and a pointer to that block's
 *  data.  The caller is responsible for both calculating the required size of the buffer before
 *  allocating, and filling it in with the schema data trees for each event that can be sent as
 *  part of that schema.  The helper functions in @ref omni::structuredlog::JsonTreeSizeCalculator and
 *  @ref omni::structuredlog::JsonBuilder can be used to build these trees.  Once these trees are built, they are
 *  stored in a number of entries in an array of @ref omni::structuredlog::EventInfo objects.  This array of event
 *  info objects is then passed to @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::commitSchema() to complete the schema
 *  registration process.
 *
 *  Sending of a message is split into two parts for efficiency.  The general idea is that the
 *  caller will allocate a block of memory in the event queue's buffer and write its data directly
 *  there.
 *  The allocation occurs with the @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocEvent() call.
 *  This will return a
 *  handle to the allocated block and a pointer to the first byte to start writing the payload
 *  data to.  The buffer's header will already have been filled in upon return from
 *  @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::allocEvent().
 *  Once the caller has written its event payload information to
 *  the buffer, it will call @ref omni::structuredlog::IStructuredLog::commitEvent()
 *  to commit the message to the queue.  At
 *  this point, the message can be consumed by the event processing thread.
 *
 *  Multiple events may be safely allocated from and written to the queue's buffer simultaneously.
 *  There is no required order that the messages be committed in however.  If a buffer is
 *  allocated after one that has not been committed yet, and that newer event is committed first,
 *  the only side effect will be that the event processing thread will be stalled in processing
 *  new events until the first message is also committed.  This is important since the events
 *  would still need to be committed to the log in the correct order.
 *
 *  All events that are processed through this interface will be written to a local log file.  The
 *  log file will be periodically consumed by an external process (the Omniverse Transmitter app)
 *  that will send all the approved events to the telemetry servers.  Only events that have been
 *  approved by legal will be sent.  All other messages will be rejected and only remain in the
 *  log files on the local machine.

     *           identifier matches that of an event that has already been registered with another
     *           schema.  This indicates that the name of the event that was used to generate the

     *           that has already been registered except for the schema flags that were used
     *           in the new one.  This is not allowed without a version change in the new schema.

     *           will be registered in this case and the schema block will be destroyed before
     *           return.
     *
     *  @remarks This registers a new schema and its events with the structured log system.  This
     *           will create a new set of events in the structured log system.  These events
     *           cannot be unregistered except by unloading the entire structured log system
     *           altogether.  Upon successful registration, the events in the schema can be
     *           emitted using the event identifiers they were registered with.
     *
     *  @remarks If the new schema matchces one that has already been registered, The operation
     *           will succeed with the result @ref omni::structuredlog::SchemaResult::eAlreadyExists.
     *           The existing
     *           schema's name, version, flags, and event table (including order of events) must

     *           (even the flags for a single event or events out of order but otherwise the same
     *           content), the call will fail.  If the schema with the differing flags or event
     *           order is to be used, its version or name must be changed to avoid conflict with
     *           the existing schema.
     *
     *  @remarks When generating the event identifiers for @ref omni::structuredlog::EventInfo::eventId it is
     *           recommended that a string uniquely identifying the event be created then hashed
     *           using an algorithm such as FNV1.  The string should contain the schema's client
     *           name, the event's name, the schema's version, and any other values that may
     *           help to uniquely identify the event.  Once hashed, it is very unlikely that
     *           the event identifier will collide with any others.  This is the method that the
     *           code generator tool uses to create the unique event identifiers.
     *
     *  @remarks Up to 65536 (ie: 16-bit index values) events may be registered with the
     *           structured log system.  The performance of managing a list of events this large
     *           is unknown and not suggested however.  Each module, app, or component should only
     *           register its schema(s) once on startup.  This can be a relatively expensive
     *           operation if done frequently and unnecessarily.

     *                          cleanup function for this handle.
     *  @returns A pointer to the buffer to use for the event's payload data if successfully
     *           allocated.  The caller should start writing its payload data at this address
     *           according to the formatting information in the requested event's schema.  This

     *           disabled.
     *  @returns `nullptr` if the event queue's buffer is full and a buffer of the requested
     *           size could not be allocated.  In this case, a invalid handle will be returned

     *           start up.
     *  @returns `nullptr` if the given event ID is not valid.
     *
     *  @remarks This is the main entry point for creating an event message.  This allocates
     *           a block of memory that the caller can fill in with its event payload data.
     *           The caller is expected to fill in this buffer as quickly as possible.  Once
