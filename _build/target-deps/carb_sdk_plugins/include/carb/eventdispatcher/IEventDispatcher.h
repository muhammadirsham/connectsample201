     *
     * Since observers can be in use by this thread or any thread, this function is carefully synchronized with all
     * other IEventDispatcher operations.
     *  - During stopObserving(), further calls to the observer are prevented, even if other threads are currently
     *    dispatching an event that would be observed by the observer in question.
     *  - If any other thread is currently calling the observer in question, stopObserving() will wait until all other
     *    threads have left the observer function.
     *  - If the observer function is \b not in the callstack of the current thread, the cleanup function provided to
     *    \c internalObserveEvent() is called and any \ref variant::Variant objects captured to filter events are
     *    destroyed.
     *  - If the observer function is in the callstack of the current thread, stopObserving() will return without
     *    waiting, calling the cleanup function or destroying \ref variant::Variant objects. Instead, this cleanup will
     *    be performed when the \ref dispatchEvent() call in the current thread finishes.
     *
     * When stopObserving() returns, it is guaranteed that the observer function will no longer be called and all calls
     * to it have completed (except if the calling thread is dispatching).
     *
     * @warning This function must be called exactly once per \ref Observer created by \ref observeEvent(). The
     * \ref ObserverGuard calls this function automatically.
     *
     * @thread_safety Safe to perform while any thread is performing any operation against IEventDispatcher.
     *
     * @param ob The \ref Observer to stop.
     * @returns \c true if the Observer was found and stopped; \c false otherwise.

     * Registers an observer with the Event Dispatcher system.
     *
     * An observer is an invokable object (function, functor, lambda, etc.) that is called whenever \ref dispatchEvent()
     * is called. The observers are invoked in the thread that calls \ref dispatchEvent(), and multiple threads could be
     * calling \ref dispatchEvent() simultaneously, so observers must be thread-safe unless the application can ensure
     * synchronization around \ref dispatchEvent() calls.
     *
     * Observers can pass zero or any number of @p filterArgs parameters. These @p filterArgs cause an observer to only
     * be invoked for a \ref dispatchEvent() call that contains at least the same values. For instance, having a filter
     * pair for key "WindowID" with a specific value will only cause the observer to be called if \ref dispatchEvent()
     * is given the same value as a "WindowID" parameter.
     *
     * Observers can be added inside of an observer notification (i.e. during a call to \ref dispatchEvent()), however
     * these new observers will <b>not be called</b> for the currently dispatching event. A subsequent recursive call to
     * \ref dispatchEvent() <em>(on the current thread only)</em> will also call the new observer. The new observer will
     * be available to all other threads once the \ref dispatchEvent() call--in which it was added--returns.
     *
     * @thread_safety Safe to perform while any thread is performing any operation against IEventDispatcher.
     *
     * @param order A value determining call order. Observers with lower order values are called earlier. Observers with
     * the same order value and same filter argument values will be called in the order they are registered. Observers
     * with the same order value with \a different filter argument values are called in an indeterminate order.
     * @param eventName The name of the event to observe.
     * @param invokable An object that is invoked when an event matching the \p eventName and \p filterArgs is
     * dispatched. The object must be callable as `void(const Event&)`.
     * @param filterArgs Zero or more arguments that filter observer invocations. Each argument must be of type
     * `std::pair<RStringKey, T>` where the first parameter is the key and the second is the value. The value must be
     * of a type understood by a \ref variant::Translator specialization.
     * @returns An \ref ObserverGuard representing the lifetime of the observer. When the \ref ObserverGuard is reset or
     * destroyed, the observer is unregistered as with \ref stopObserving().
