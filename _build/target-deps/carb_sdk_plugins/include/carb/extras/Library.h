 *        is considered undefined behaviour.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure the

 *        invalid library handle will technically fail gracefully, however it is still considered
 *        undefined behaviour since another library could be reloaded into the same space in
 *        memory at a later time.

 *
 *  @remarks This attempts to dynamically load a named library into the calling process using `LoadLibraryExW` on
 *           Windows and `dlopen` on Linux/Mac.  If the library is already loaded, a handle to it is returned.  If the
 *           module was not already loaded, it is dynamically loaded and a handle to it is returned.  When a module is
 *           dynamically loaded into a process, its existence in the process is reference counted.  A newly loaded
 *           library will be given a reference count of one.  Each time the same dynamically library is loaded, its
 *           reference count is incremented.  Each successful call to this function should therefore be balanced by a
 *           call to \ref unloadLibrary.
 *
 *  @remarks Modules that were loaded as part of the process's static dependencies list will
 *           be 'pinned' and their reference count will not be changed by attempting to load
 *           them.  It is still safe to call unloadLibrary() on handles for those pinned
