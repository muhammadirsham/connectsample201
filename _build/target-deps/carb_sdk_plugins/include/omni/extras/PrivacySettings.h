/** Static helper class to provide standardized access to the telemetry privacy setting values.
 *  These settings provide information such as the active user ID and the consent permissions
 *  for the various event types.  These settings are expected to already have been loaded into
 *  the settings registry (accessible through ISettings).  This just provides simple access
 *  to the settings values but does not provide functionality for loading the settings in the
 *  first place or providing a wrapper for change subscriptions on those settings.
 *
 *  Loading the settings is left up to the `omni.structuredlog.plugin` module.  This module will
 *  manage loading the settings when it initializes.  It will also refresh the settings any
 *  time the original settings file for them changes.  This file is located at
 *  `$HOME_PATH/.nvidia-omniverse/config/privacy.toml` (where `$HOME_PATH` is the user's home
 *  directory on the local system).
 *
 *  This helper class does not directly handle change subscriptions to the various privacy
 *  settings.  This is done to avoid complication and potential issues during shutdown
 *  of global objects.  It does however expose the paths of the various privacy settings
 *  so that external callers can subscribe for and manage their own change notifications.
 *
 *  @note The methods in this helper class are just as thread safe as the ISettings interface
 *        itself is when retrieving a value.  All methods are static so there is no state
 *        data that could be clobbered by multiple threads in this object itself.
 *
 *  @note The Carbonite framework must be initialized before using this helper class.  A
 *        crash will occur if the framework is not initialized first.
