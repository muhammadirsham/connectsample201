/** Replaces path alias markers in a path with the full names.
 *
 *  @param[in] srcBuf The path to potentially replace path alias markers in.  Any path
 *                    alias markers in the string must be surrounded by "${" and "}" characters
 *                    (ie: "${exampleMarker}/file.txt").  The markers will only be replaced if a
 *                    path alias using the same marker name ("exampleMarker" in the previous
 *                    example) is currently registered.
 *  @returns A string containing the resolved path if path alias markers were replaced.
 *  @returns A string containing the original path if no path alias markers were found or
 *           replaced.
 *
 *  @remarks This resolves a path string by replacing path alias markers with their full
 *           paths.  Markers must be registered with registerPathAlias() in order to be
 *           replaced.  This will always return a new string, but not all of the markers
 *           may have been replaced in it is unregistered markers were found.
 *
 *  @remarks A replaced path will never end in a trailing path separator.  It is the caller's
 *           responsibility to ensure the marker(s) in the string are appropriately separated
 *           from other path components.  This behaviour does however allow for path aliases
 *           to be used to construct multiple path names by piecing together different parts
 *           of a name.
 *
 *  @note This operation is always thread safe.
