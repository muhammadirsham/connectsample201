/**
 * A Future is a counterpart to a Promise. It is the receiving end of a one-way, one-time asynchronous communication
 * channel for transmitting the result of an asynchronous operation.
 *
 * Future is very similar to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future">std::future</a>
 *
 * Communication starts by creating a Promise. The Promise has an associated Future that can be retrieved once via
 * Promise::get_future(). The Promise and the Future both reference a "shared state" that is used to communicate the
 * resut. When the result is available, it is set through Promise::set_value() (or the promise can be broken through
 * Promise::setCanceled()), at which point the shared state becomes Ready and the Future will be able to retrieve the
 * value through Future::get() (or determine cancellation via Future::isCanceled()).
 *
 * Task functions like ITasking::addTask() return a Future where the Promise side is the return value from the callable
 * passed when the task is created.
 *
 * Future is inherently a "read-once" object. Once Future::get() is called, the Future becomes invalid. However,
 * SharedFuture can be used (created via Future::share()) to retain the value. Many threads can wait on a SharedFuture
 * and access the result simultaneously through SharedFuture::get().
 *
 * There are three specializations of Future:
 * * Future<T>: The base specialization, used to communicate objects between tasks/threads.
 * * Future<T&>: Reference specialization, used to communicate references between tasks/threads.
 * * Future<void>: Void specialization, used to communicate stateless events between tasks/threads.
 *
 * The `void` specialization of Future is slightly different:
 * * Future<void> does not have Future::isCanceled(); cancellation state cannot be determined.

/**
 * A facility to store a value that is later acquired asynchronously via a Future created via Promise::get_future().
 *
 * The carb.tasking implementation is very similar to the C++11 <a
 * href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/promise">std::promise</a>.
 *
 * A promise has a "shared state" that is shared with the Future that it creates through Promise::get_future().
 *
 * A promise is a single-use object. The get_future() function may only be called once, and either set_value() or
 * setCanceled() may only be called once.
 *
 * A promise that is destroyed without ever having called set_value() or setCanceled() is consider a broken promise and
 * automatically calls setCanceled().
 *
 * There are three specializations of Promise:
 * * Promise<T>: The base specialization, used to communicate objects between tasks/threads.
 * * Promise<T&>: Reference specialization, used to communicate references between tasks/threads.
 * * Promise<void>: Void specialization, used to communicate stateless events between tasks/threads.
 *
 * The `void` specialization of Promise is slightly different:
 * * Promise<void> does not have Promise::setCanceled(); cancellation state cannot be determined.
