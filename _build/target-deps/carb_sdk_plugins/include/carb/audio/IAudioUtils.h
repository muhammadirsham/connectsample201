     *  @remarks This converts a sound data object from one format to another or duplicates an
     *           object.  The conversion operation may be performed on the same sound data object
     *           or it may create a new object.  The returned sound data object always needs to
     *           be released with release() when it is no longer needed.  This is true
     *           whether the original object was copied or not.
     *
     *  @note The destruction callback is not copied to the returned SoundData
     *        even if an in-place conversion is requested.
     *
     *  @note If @ref fConvertFlagInPlace is passed and the internal buffer
     *        of the input SoundData is being replaced, the original
     *        destruction callback on the input SoundData will be called.
