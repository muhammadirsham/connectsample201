/**
 * Implements a thread-safe callback system that can have multiple subscribers.
 *
 * A delegate is a weak-coupling callback system. Essentially, a system uses Delegate to have a callback that can
 * be received by multiple subscribers.
 *
 * Delegate has two ways to uniquely identify a bound callback: \ref Bind() will output a \ref Handle, or the
 * caller can provide a key of any type with BindWithKey(). Either the \ref Handle or the given key can be passed to
 * \ref Unbind() in order to remove a callback.
 *
 * Delegate can call all bound callbacks with the Call() function. Recursive calling is allowed with caveats listed
 * below.
 *
 * Delegate is thread-safe for all operations. Call() can occur simultaneously in multiple threads. An Unbind()
 * will wait if the bound callback is currently executing in another thread.
 *
 * Delegate can be destroyed from a binding (during \ref Call()) as the internal state is not disposed of
 * until all active calls have been completed. See ~Delegate().
 *
 * Delegate does not hold any internal locks while calling bound callbacks. It is strongly recommended to avoid
 * holding locks when invoking Delegate's \ref Call() function.
 *
 * These tenets make up the basis of Carbonite's Basic Callback Hygiene as described in the @rstdoc{../../../../CODING}.
