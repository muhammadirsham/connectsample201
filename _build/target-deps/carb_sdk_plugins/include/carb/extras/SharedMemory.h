/** A utility helper class to provide shared memory access to one or more processes.  The shared
 *  memory area is named so that it can be opened by another process or component using the same
 *  name.  Once created, views into the shared memory region can be created.  Each successfully
 *  created view will unmap the mapped region once the view object is deleted.  This object and
 *  any created view objects exist independently from each other - the ordering of destruction
 *  of each does not matter.  The shared memory region will exist in the system until the last
 *  reference to it is released through destruction.
 *
 *  A shared memory region must be mapped into a view before it can be accessed in memory.  A
 *  new view can be created with the createView() function as needed.  As long as one SharedMemory
 *  object still references the region, it can still be reopened by another call to open().  Each
 *  view object maps the region to a different location in memory.  The view's mapped address will
 *  remain valid as long as the view object exists.  Successfully creating a new view object
 *  requires that the mapping was successful and that the mapped memory is valid.  The view object
 *  can be wrapped in a smart pointer such as std::unique_ptr<> if needed to manage its lifetime.
 *  A view object should never be copied (byte-wise or otherwise).
 *
 *  A view can also be created starting at non-zero offsets into the shared memory region.  This
 *  is useful for only mapping a small view of a very large shared memory region into the memory
 *  space.  Multiple views of the same shared memory region may be created simultaneously.
 *
 *  When opening a shared memory region, an 'open token' must be acquired first.  This token can
 *  be retrieved from any other shared memory region object that either successfully created or
 *  opened the region using getOpenToken().  This token can then be transmitted to any other
 *  client through some means to be used to open the same region.  The open token data can be
 *  retrieved as a base64 encoded string for transmission to other processes.  The target process
 *  can then create its own local open token from the base64 string using the constructor for
 *  SharedMemory::OpenToken.  Open tokens can also be passed around within the same process or
 *  through an existing shared memory region as needed by copying, moving, or assigning it to
 *  another object.
 *
 *  @note On Linux, this requires that the host app be linked with the "rt" and "pthread" system
 *        libraries.  This can be done by adding 'links { "rt", "pthread" }' to the premake script
 *        or adding the "-lrt -lpthread" option to the build command line.

     *           already exists or that the name was invalid (ie: contained invalid characters).
     *  @returns `false` if another shared memory region is currently open on this object.  In this
     *           case, close() must be called before attempting to create a new region.
     *
     *  @remarks This creates a new shared memory region in the system.  If successful, this new
     *           region will be guaranteed to be different from all other shared memory regions
     *           in the system.  The new region will always be opened for read and write access.
     *           New views into this shared memory region may be created upon successful creation
     *           using createView().  Any created view object will remain valid even if this
     *           object is closed or destroyed.  Note however that other clients will only be
     *           able to open this same shared memory region if are least one SharedMemory object
     *           still has the region open in any process in the system.  If all references to
     *           the region are closed, all existing views to it will remain valid, but no new
     *           clients will be able to open the same region by name.  This is a useful way to
     *           'lock down' a shared memory region once all expected client(s) have successfully
     *           opened it.
     *
     *  @note On Linux it is possible to have region creation fail if the @ref fCreateMakeUnique
     *        flag is not used because the region objects were leaked on the filesystem by another
     *        potentially crashed process (or the region was never closed).  This is also possible
     *        on Windows, however instead of failing to create the region, an existing region will
     *        be opened instead.  In both cases, this will be detected as a failure since a new
     *        unique region could not be created as expected.  It is best practice to always use
     *        the @ref fCreateMakeUnique flag here.  Similarly, it is always best practice to
     *        close all references to a region after all necessary views have been created if it
     *        is intended to persist for the lifetime of the process.  This will guarantee that
     *        all references to the region get released when the process exits (regardless of
     *        method).
     *
     *  @note On Linux, some malware scanners such as rkhunter check for large shared memory
     *        regions and flag them as potential root kits.  It is best practice to use a
     *        descriptive name for a shared memory region so that they can be easily dismissed
     *        as not a problem in a malware report log.

     *  @returns A new view object representing the mapped view of the shared memory region.
     *           This must be deleted when the mapped region is no longer needed.
     *  @returns `nullptr` if the new view cannot be created or if an invalid set of parameters is
     *           passed in.
     *
     *  @remarks This creates a new view into this shared memory region.  The default behaviour
     *           (with no parameters) is to map the entire shared memory region into the new view.
     *           Multiple views into the same shared memory region can be created simultaneously.
     *           It is safe to close the shared memory region or delete the object after a new
     *           view is successfully created.  In this case, the view object and the mapped
     *           memory will still remain valid as long as the view object still exists.  This
     *           shared memory object can similarly also safely close and open a new region
     *           while views on the previous region still exist.  The previous region will only
     *           be completely invalidated once all views are deleted and all other open

     *
     *  @note On Windows, the @p offset parameter should be additionally aligned to the system's
     *        allocation granularity (ie: getSystemAllocationGranularity()).  Under this object
     *        however, this additional alignment requirement is handled internally so that page
     *        alignment is provided to match Linux behaviour.  However, this does mean that
     *        additional pages may be mapped into memory that are just transparently skipped by
     *        the view object.  When on Windows, it would be a best practice to align the view
     *        offsets to a multiple of the system allocation granularity (usually 64KB) instead
     *        of just the page size (usually 4KB).  This larger offset granularity behaviour
     *        will also work properly on Linux.
