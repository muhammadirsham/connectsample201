/**
 * Futex namespace.
 *
 * @warning Futex is a very low-level system; generally its use should be avoided. There are plenty of higher level
 * synchronization primitives built on top of Futex that should be used instead, such as `carb::cpp20::atomic`.
 *
 * FUTEX stands for Fast Userspace muTEX. Put simply, it's a way of efficiently blocking threads waiting for a condition
 * to become true. It is a low-level system, and a foundation for many synchronization primitives.
 *
 * Windows has a similar mechanism through WaitOnAddress. While WaitOnAddress allows the value waited on to be either
 * 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes, Linux requires the value be 32-bit (4 bytes). For Linux sizes other than 4 bytes, details::Futex
 * has its own simple futex implementation on top of the system futex implementation.
 *
 * Linux information: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html

 * when the value changes. The thread that changes the value must then call wake() to wake the waiting threads.
 *
 * @note Futexes are prone to spurious wakeups. It is the responsibility of the caller to determine whether a return
 * from wait() is spurious or valid.
