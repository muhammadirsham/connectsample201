/** ICrashReporter is the interface to implement a plugin that catches and reports information
 *  about the crash to either a local file, a server, or both.
 *
 *  ICrashReporter is an optional plugin that is automatically loaded by the framework and doesn't
 *  need to be specifically listed in the configuration.  If an ICrashReporter plugin is found,
 *  it's enabled.  Only one ICrashReporter instance is supported at a time.
 *
 *  The crash report itself consists of multiple parts.  Some parts are only present on certain
 *  supported platforms.  All generated crash dump files will appear in the directory named by the
 *  "/crashreporter/dumpDir" setting.  If no value is provided, the current working directory
 *  is used instead.  The following parts could be expected:
 *    * A minidump file.  This is only generated on Windows.  This file will contain the state of
 *      the process's threads, stack memory, global memory space, register values, etc at the time
 *      of the crash.  This file will end in '.dmp'.
 *    * A stack trace of the crash point file.  This could be produced on all platforms.  This
 *      file will end in '.txt'.
 *    * A metadata file.  This is a TOML formatted file that contains all the metadata values that
 *      were known by the crash reporter at the time of the crash.  This file will end in '.toml'.
 *
 *  The crash reporter may have any number of arbitrary metadata values associated with it.  These
 *  values are defined as key/value pair strings.  There are two ways a metadata value can be
 *  defined:
 *    * Add a value to the `/crashreporter/data/` branch of the settings registry.  This can be
 *      done directly through the ISettings interface, adding a value to one of the app's config
 *      files, or by using the addCrashMetadata() utility function.  These values should be set
 *      once and either never or very rarely modified.  There is a non-trivial amount of work
 *      related to collecting a new metadata value in this manner that could lead to an overall
 *      performance impact if done too frequently.
 *    * Add a key and data callback to collect the current value of a metadata key for something
 *      that changes frequently.  This type of metadata value is added with addVolatileMetadata()
 *      on this interface.  These values may change as frequently as needed.  The current value
 *      will only ever be collected when a crash does occur or when the callback is removed.
 *
 *  Once a metadata value has been added to the crash reporter, it cannot be removed.  The value
 *  will remain even if the key is removed from `/crashreporter/data/` or its value callback is
 *  removed.  This is intentional so that as much data as possible can be collected to be sent
 *  with the crash report as is possible.
 *
 *  If a metadata key is registered as a volatile value, it will always override a key of the
 *  same name that is found under the `/crashreporter/data/` branch of the settings registry.
 *  Even if the volatile metadata value is removed or unregistered, it will still override any
 *  key of the same name found in the settings registry.
 *
 *  Metadata key names may or may not be case sensitive depending on their origin.  If a metadata
 *  value comes from the settings registry, its name is case sensitive since the settings registry
 *  is also case sensitive.  Metadata values that are registered as volatile metadata values do
 *  not have case sensitive names.  Attempting to register a new value under the same key but with
 *  different casing will fail since it would overwrite an existing name.  This difference is
 *  intentional to avoid confusion in the metadata output.  When adding metadata values through
 *  the settings registry, care should be taken to use consistent casing to avoid confusion in
 *  the output.

     *           discourage the implementations from doing their own string conversions that could
     *           be dangerous while handling a crash event.
     *
     *  @remarks Because the process may be in an unstable or delicate state when the callback
     *           is performed to retrieve the metadata values, there are several restrictions on
     *           what the callback function can and cannot do.  In general, the callback function
     *           should provide the metadata value as quickly and simply as possible.  An ideal
     *           case would be just to return the current value of a local, global, or member
     *           variable.  Some guidelines are:
     *            * Do not perform any allocations or call into anything that may perform an
     *              allocation.  At the time of a crash many things could have gone wrong and the
     *              allocations could fail or hang for various reasons.
     *            * Do not use any STL container classes other than to retrieve a current value.

    /** Adds a new volatile metadata value to the crash report.
     *
     *  @param[in] keyName      The name of the metadata key to set.  This must only contain
     *                          printable ASCII characters except for a double quote ('"'),
     *                          slash ('/'), or whitespace.  It is the caller's responsibility
     *                          to ensure the key name will not be overwriting another system's
     *                          metadata value.  One way to do this is to prefix the key name
     *                          with the name of the extension or plugin (sanitized to follow
     *                          the above formatting rules).  Volatile metadata key names are
     *                          not case sensitive.  This may not be `nullptr` or an empty string.
     *  @param[in] callback     The callback function that will provide the value for the new
     *                          metadata key.  This may not be a `nullptr` callback function.
     *                          See below for notes on what the callback function may and may not
     *                          do.
     *  @param[in] context      An opaque context pointer that will be passed to the callback
     *                          function when called.  This will not be accessed or evaluated in
     *                          any way, but must remain valid for the entire duration that the
     *                          callback is registered here.
     *  @returns An identifier that can be used to unregister the callback in the event that the
     *           owning module needs to be unloaded.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure
     *           that the metadata callback is properly unregstistered with a call to
     *           removeVolatileMetadataValue() before it unloads.
     *
     *  @returns @ref kMetadataFailBadParameter if an invalid parameter is passed in.  Returns
     *           @ref kMetadataFailKeyAlreadyUsed if the given key name is already in use or is
     *           a reserved name.  Returns @ref kInvalidMetadataId if a crash dump is currently
     *           in progress during this call.
     *
     *  @remarks This registers a new volatile metadata value with the crash reporter.  This new
     *           value includes a callback that will be used to acquire the most recent value of
     *           the metadata key when a crash does occur.  The value may be provided as either a
     *           signed or unsigned integer (64 bit), a floating point value (64 bit), or a string
     *           of arbitrary length.  Callback types are intentionally provided for each type to
     *           discourage the implementations from doing their own string conversions that could
     *           be dangerous while handling a crash event.
     *
     *  @remarks Because the process may be in an unstable or delicate state when the callback
     *           is performed to retrieve the metadata values, there are several restrictions on
     *           what the callback function can and cannot do.  In general, the callback function
     *           should provide the metadata value as quickly and simply as possible.  An ideal
     *           case would be just to return the current value of a local, global, or member
     *           variable.  Some guidelines are:
     *            * Do not perform any allocations or call into anything that may perform an
     *              allocation.  At the time of a crash, many things could have gone wrong and
     *              allocations could fail or hang for various reasons.
     *            * Do not use any STL container classes other than to retrieve a current value.
     *              Many STL container class operations can implicitly perform an allocation
     *              to resize a buffer, array, new node, etc.  If a resize, copy, or assign
     *              operation is unavoidable, try to use a container class that provides the
     *              possiblility to reserve space for expected operations early (ie: string,
     *              vector, etc).
     *            * Avoid doing anything that may use a mutex or other locking primitive that
     *              is not in a strictly known state at the time.  During a crash, the state of
     *              any lock could be undefined leading to a hang if an attempt is made to
     *              acquire it.  If thread safety is a concern around accessing the value, try
     *              using an atomic variable instead of depending on a lock.
     *            * Do not make any calls into ICrashReporter from the callback function.  This
     *              will result in a deadlock.
     *            * Under no circumstances should a new thread be created by the callback.

     *  @thread_safety This call is thread safe.
