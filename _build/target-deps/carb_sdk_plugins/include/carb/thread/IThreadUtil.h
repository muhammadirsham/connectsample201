     *
     *  @param[inout] desc  The descriptor of the task to be run.  This task includes a function
     *                      to execute and a context value to pass to that function.  This
     *                      descriptor must remain valid for the entire lifetime of the execution
     *                      of the task function.  If the @ref fRelayFlagBlocking flag is used,
     *                      this call will block until the task completes.  In this case, the
     *                      caller will be responsible for cleaning up any resources used or

     *  @returns @ref RelayResult::eSuccess if executing the task is successful.
     *  @returns An error code describing how the task relay failed.
     *
     *  @remarks This relays a task to run on an internal worker thread.  This worker thread will
     *           be guaranteed to continue running (in an efficient sleep state when not running
     *           a task) for the entire remaining lifetime of the process.  The thread will be
     *           terminated during shutdown of the process.
     *
     *  @remarks The intention of this function is to be able to run generic tasks on a worker
     *           thread that is guaranteed to live throughout the process's lifetime.  Other
     *           similar systems in other plugins have the possibility of being unloaded before
     *           the end of the process which would lead to the task worker thread(s) being
     *           stopped early.  Certain tasks such may require the instantiating thread to
     *           survive longer than the lifetime of a dynamic plugin.
     *
     *  @remarks A task function may queue another task when it executes.  However, the behaviour
     *           may differ depending on whether the newly queued task is flagged as being
     *           blocking or non-blocking.  A recursive blocking task will be executed immediately
     *           in the context of the task thread, but will interrupt any other pending tasks
     *           that were queued ahead of it.  A recursive non-blocking task will always maintain
     *           queueing order however.  Note that recursive tasks may require extra care to
     *           wait for or halt upon module shutdown or unload.  In these cases, it is still
     *           the caller's responsibility to ensure all tasks queued by a module are safely
     *           and properly stopped before that module is unloaded.
     *
     *  @note This should only be used in situations where it is absolutely necessary.  In
     *        cases where performance or more flexibility are needed, other interfaces such as
     *        ITasking should be used instead.
     *
     *  @note If a caller in another module queues a non-blocking task, it is that caller's
     *        responsibility to ensure that task has completed before its module is unloaded.
     *        This can be accomplished by queueing a do-nothing blocking task.
