/**
 * Carbonite registered strings.
 *
 * The Carbonite framework has a rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">string-interning</a>
 * interface that is very easily used through the RString (and other) classes. This implements a <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern">Flyweight pattern</a> for strings. The registered string
 * interface is fully ABI-safe due to versioning, and can even be used in an application prior to the `main()`,
 * `WinMain()` or `DllMain()` functions being called. Furthermore, the API is fully thread-safe.
 *
 * Registered strings have pre-computed hashes which make them ideal for identifiers and map keys, and string
 * (in-)equality checks are O(1) constant time. For ordered containers, registered strings have an `owner_before()`
 * function that can be used for stable (though not lexicographical) ordering. If lexicographical ordering is desired,
 * O(n) `compare()` functions are provided.
 *
 * Variations exist around case-sensitivity. The RStringU class (the U stands for "un-cased" which is used in this API
 * to denote case-insensitivity) is used to register a string that will compare in a case-insensitive manner. Although
 * RString and RStringU cannot be directly compared for equality, RString::toUncased() exists to explicitly create a
 * case-insensitive RStringU from an RString which can then be compared.
 *
 * Variations also exist around using registered strings as a key value. It can be useful to have an associated number
 * to denote multiple instances of a registered string: hence the RStringKey and RStringUKey classes.
 *
 * To register a string, pass a string to the RString constructor RAII-style. Strings that are registered stay as such
 * for the entire run of the application; strings are never unregistered. Registered strings are stored in a named
 * section of shared memory accessible by all modules loaded by an application. The memory for registered strings is
 * allocated directly from the operating system to avoid cross-DLL heap issues.
 *
 * @note Registered strings are a limited resource, but there exists slots for approximately two million strings.
 *
 * Variations:
 * * RStringU - an "un-cased" (i.e. case-insensitive) registered string
 * * RStringKey - Adds a numeric component to RString to create an identifier or key.
 * * RStringUKey - Adds a numeric component to RStringU to create an identifer or key that is case-insensitive.
