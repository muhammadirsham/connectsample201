/** Prototype for a stream read callback function.
 *
 *  @param[in] data     The buffer of data that was read from the child process's stream.  This
 *                      will never be `nullptr`.  Only the first @p bytes bytes of data in this
 *                      buffer will contain valid data.  Any data beyond that should be considered
 *                      undefined and not accessed.
 *  @param[in] bytes    The number of bytes of valid data in the @p data buffer.  This will never
 *                      be 0 as long as the connection to the child process is active.  When the
 *                      child process exits and the read thread has read all of the data from the
 *                      child process, one final callback will be performed passing 0 for the byte
 *                      count to indicate the end of the stream.  This count will not exceed the
 *                      buffer size specified in the original call to ILauncher::openProcess().
 *  @param[in] context  The context value that was originally passed to ILauncher::openProcess()
 *                      when the child process was created.
 *  @returns No return value.
 *
 *  @remarks This callback will be performed any time data is successfully read from one of the
 *           child process's output streams (ie: `stdout` or `stderr`).  The call will be performed
 *           on a worker thread that was created specifically for the child process.  This
 *           callback will be performed as soon after reading the data as possible.  The reader
 *           thread will remain in an efficient wait state while there is no data read to be
 *           read.  It is the callback's responsibility to ensure any shared resources that are
 *           accessed in the callback are appropriately protected from race conditions and
 *           general thread safety issues.
 *
 *  @remarks When reading from one of the child process' output streams, every effort will be
 *           taken to ensure the contents of at least one 'message' is delivered to the callback
 *           at a time.  A message can be thought of as the unit of data that was last written
 *           to the stream on the child process's side - for example, the output of a single call
 *           to fwrite() or fprintf().  However, there are a some caveats to this behaviour that
 *           the callback and its owner need to be able to handle:
 *            * It is possible that depending on the size and arrival times of messages, multiple
 *              messages may be concatenated into a single callback call.  The callback needs to
 *              be able to handle this by being able to identify expected message ends and
 *              properly parse them out if needed.
 *            * If the current message or set of messages fills up the read buffer, the buffer
 *              as it is will be delivered to the callback with the last message truncated.  The
 *              remainder of the message will be sent in the next callback.  The callback needs
 *              to be able to handle this by either using a buffer size appropriate for the
 *              expected output of the child process, or by having the callback simply concatenate
 *              incoming data onto a data queue that is then processed elsewhere.
 *
 *  @remarks This callback should attempt to complete its task as quickly as possible to avoid
 *           blocking the read thread.  If the callback blocks or takes a long time to process
 *           it may result in blocking the child process's attempts to write to the stream.  The
 *           child process' thread will be effectively stopped until buffer space is freed up
 *           on the parent's read side.  It is best practice to have the callback simply queue
 *           up new data for later consumption on another thread in the parent process or to do
 *           a few simple string or data checks if searching for a specific incoming data message.
 *
 *  @remarks When the stream for this callback ends due to either the child or parent process
 *           closing it, one final callback will be performed.  The last callback will always
 *           have a @p bytes value of 0 in this case.  All other callbacks during the stream
 *           will have a non-zero @p bytes value.  Even in this final callback case however,
 *           a non-`nullptr` @p data buffer will still be provided.  Once the zero sized buffer
 *           has been delivered, the parent process can safely assume that the child process
 *           is done transmitting any data to the parent.

/** A simple process launcher helper interface.  This is responsible for creating child processes,
 *  tracking their lifetime, and communicating with the child processes.  All operations on this
 *  interface are thread safe within themselves.  It is the caller's responsibility to manage the
 *  lifetime of and any multi-threaded access to each process handle object that is returned from
 *  launchProcess().  For example, destroying a process handle object while another thread is
 *  operating on it will result in undefined behaviour.
 *
 *  Linux notes:
 *    * If any other component of the software using this plugin sets the SIGCHLD handler back to
 *      default behaviour (ie: SIG_DFL) or installs a SIGCHLD handler funciton, any child process
 *      that exits while the parent is still running will become a zombie process.  The only way
 *      to remove a zombie process in this case is to wait on it in the parent process with
 *      waitProcessExit() or getProcessExitCode() at some point after the child process has
 *      exited.  Explicitly killing the child process with killProcess() will also avoid creating
 *      a zombie process.
 *    * Setting the SIGCHLD handler to be ignored (ie: SIG_IGN) will completely break the ability
 *      to wait on the exit of any child process for this entire process.  Any call to wait on a
 *      child process such as waitProcessExit() or getProcessExitCode() will fail immediately.
 *      There is no way to detect or work around this situation on the side of this interface
 *      since signal handlers are process-wide and can be installed at any time by any component
 *      of the process.
 *    * The problem with leaving a zombie processes hanging around is that it continues to take
 *      up a slot in the kernel's process table.  If this process table fills up, the kernel
 *      will not be able to launch any new processes (or threads).  All of the zombie children
 *      of a process will be automatically cleaned up when the parent exits however.
 *    * If a read callback is provided for either `stdout` or `stderr` of the child process and
 *      the parent process destroys its process handle for the child process before the child
 *      process exits, the child process will be terminated with SIGPIPE if it ever tries to
 *      write to either stream again.  This is the default Linux kernel behaviour for writing
 *      to a broken pipe or socket.  The only portable way around this is to ensure the child
 *      process will ignore SIGPIPE signals.  It is generally best practice to ensure the parent
 *      process waits on all child processes before destroying its process handle.  This also
 *      prevents the appearance of zombie processes as mentioned above.
 *
 *  Windows notes:
 *    * Reading from a child process's `stdout` or `stderr` streams will not necessarily be
 *      aligned to the end of a single 'message' (ie: the contents of a single write call on the
 *      child process's end of the stream).  This means that a partial message may be received in
 *      the callbacks registered during the launch of a child process.  It is left up to the
 *      caller to accumulate input from these streams until an appropriate delimiter has been
 *      reached and the received data can be fully parsed.  This may be fixed in a future version
 *      of this interface.

     *           it is the caller's responsibility to call kill() before destroying the handle.

     *        group-ID capabilities set on it when using the @ref carb::launcher::fLaunchFlagKillOnParentExit
     *        flag.  These executables will clear the setting that allows the child process
     *        to receive a signal when the parent process exits for any reason (ie: exits
     *        gracefully, crashes, is externally terminated, etc).  Setting these capabilities
     *        on an executable file requires running something along the lines of:
     *          * @code{.sh}
     *            sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep <filename>
     *            sudo setcap cap_setgid+ep <filename>
     *            @endcode
     *
     *  @note Any built executable will, be default, not have any of these capabilities set.
     *        They will have to be explicitly set by a user, installer, or script.  These
     *        executables can be identified in an "ls -laF" output by either being highlighted
     *        in red (default bash colour scheme), or by having the '-rwsr-xr-x' permissions
     *        (or similar) instead of '-rwxr-xr-x', or by passing the executable path to
     *        'capsh --print' to see what it's effective or permissive capabilities are.
     *
     *  @note If a set-user-ID or set-group-ID executable needs to be launched as a child process
     *        and the @ref fLaunchFlagKillOnParentExit flag is desired for it, the child process
     *        should call @code{.cpp}prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGTERM)@endcode early in its main()
     *        function to regain this behaviour.  The restoreParentDeathSignal() helper function
     *        is also offered here to make that call easier in Carbonite apps.  Note however that
     *        there will be a possible race condition in this case - if the parent exits before
     *        the child process calls prctl(), the child process will not be signalled.  Also note
     *        that unconditionally calling one of these functions in a child process will result
     *        in the @ref fLaunchFlagKillOnParentExit behaviour being imposed on that child
     *        process regardless of whether the flag was used by the parent process.
     *
     *  @note Since we can neither guarantee the child process will be a Carbonite app nor that
     *        it will even be source under control of the same developer (ie: a command line
