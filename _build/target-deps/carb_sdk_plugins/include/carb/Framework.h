//! Defines the framework for creating Carbonite applications and plugins.
//!
//! See \carb_framework_overview for high-level documentation on core concepts, using @ref Framework, and creating
//! plugins.
//!
//! Plugins are shared libraries with a .plugin.dll/.so suffix. The plugins are named with the .plugin suffix to support
//! plugin discovery and support cohabitation with other supporting .dll/.so libraries in the same folder. It is a
//! recommended naming pattern, but not mandatory.
//!
//! Plugin library file format:
//!
//! - Windows: <plugin-name>.plugin.dll
//! - Linux:   lib<plugin-name>.plugin.so
//!
//! A plugin implements one or many interfaces and has a name which uniquely identifies it to the framework. The
//! plugin's name usually matches the filename, but it is not mandatory, the actual plugin name is provided by the
//! plugin via @ref carb::OnPluginRegisterFn.
//!
//! "Static" plugin can also be registered with @ref Framework::registerPlugin() function, thus no shared library will
//! be involved.
//!
//! @ref Framework comes with 3 static plugins:
//!
//! - @ref carb::logging::ILogging
//! - @ref carb::filesystem::IFileSystem
//! - @ref carb::assert::IAssert
//!
//! These plugins are used by @ref Framework itself. Without @ref carb::logging::ILogging, @ref Framework won't be able
//! to log messages. Without @ref carb::filesystem::IFileSystem, @ref Framework won't be able to load any "dynamic"
//! plugins. Without @ref carb::assert::IAssert, assertion failures will simply write a message to stderr and abort.
//!
//! It's up to the application to register these needed plugins.  @ref OMNI_CORE_INIT() performs this registration on
//! the user's behalf.
//!
//! The term "client" is often used across the @ref Framework API. Client is either:
//!
//! - A plugin. Here the client name is the same as the plugin name.
//!
//! - An application. The module which dynamically links with the Framework and uses @ref carb::acquireFramework().
//!
//! - Scripting bindings. This is technically similar to an application, in that it dynamically links with the @ref
//!   Framework and uses @ref carb::acquireFramework().
//!
//! Clients are uniquely identified by their name. Many functions accept client name as an argument. This allows @ref
//! Framework to create a dependency tree amonst clients.  This dependency tree allows the safe unloading of plugins.
//!
//! @thread_safety Unless otherwise noted, @ref Framework functions are thread-safe and may be called from multiple
//! threads simultaneously.
