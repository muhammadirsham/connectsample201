/** The setting path for the event identifier mode.  This controls how event identifiers are

 *  own benefits and drawbacks:
 *    * `sequential` ensures that all generated event IDs are in sequential order.  When the
 *      event ID type is set to `UUID`, this will ensure that each generated event ID can be
 *      easily sorted after the previous one.  With a UUID type ID, this mode can be expensive
 *      to generate.  With a `uint64` ID, this is the most performant to generate.
 *    * `fast-sequential` is only effective when the event ID type is set to 'UUID'.  In this
 *      mode, the UUIDs that are generated are sequential, but in memory order, not lexigraphical
 *      order.  It takes some extra effort to sort these events on the data analysis side, but
 *      they are generated very quickly.  When the event ID type is not 'UUID', this mode behaves
 *      in the same way as `sequential`.
 *    * `random` generates a random event ID for each new event.  This does not preserve any
 *      kind of order of events.  If the app does not require sequential events, this can be
 *      more performant to generate especially for UUIDs.
 *
 *  This defaults to 'fast-sequential.  This setting is not case sensitive.

 *    * `UUID` generates a 128 bit universally unique identifier.  The event ID mode determines
 *      how one event ID will be related to the next.  This is printed into each event message
 *      in the standard UUID format ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000").  This type provides
 *      the most uniqueness and room for scaling in large data sets.
 *    * `uint64` generates a 64 bit integer identifier.  The event ID mode determines how one
 *      event ID will be related to the next.  This is printed into each event message as a
 *      simple decimal integer value.
