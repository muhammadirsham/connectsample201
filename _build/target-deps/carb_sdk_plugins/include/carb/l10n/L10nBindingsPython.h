This function retrieves a localized string based on the hash of the keystring.
This should be used on all strings found in the UI, so that they can
automatically be shown in the correct language. Strings returned from this
function should never be cached, so that changing the language at runtime will
not result in stale strings being shown in the UI.

Args:
    string: The keystring that identifies the set of localized strings to
            return.  This will typically correspond to the US English string
            for this UI text.  This string will be returned if there is no
            localization table entry for this key.

Returns:
    The localized string for the input hash in the currently set language, if
    a string exists for that language.

    If no localized string from the currently set language exists for the hash,
    the US english string will be returned.
