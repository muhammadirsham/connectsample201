/** A templated helper class to provide a simple resizable scratch buffer.  The buffer will only
 *  perform a dynamic allocation if the requested size requires it.  If only a small size is
 *  needed, a stack buffer will be used instead.  The intended usage pattern is to create the
 *  object, set its required size, then write to each item in the array as needed.  The buffer
 *  will not be initialized unless the contained type is a class that constructs itself.  It
 *  is left up to the caller to initialize the buffer's contents in all other cases.
 *
 *  The buffer will always occupy enough stack space to hold the larger of 512 bytes worth of
 *  the contained type, or 16 items of the contained type.  If the size is set beyond that
 *  limit, a new buffer will be allocated from the heap.  There is no tracking of how many
 *  items have been written to the buffer - that is left as an exercise for the caller.
 *
 *  @thread_safety There are no thread safety protections on this class.  This is intended
 *                 to be used as a local scratch buffer.  If potential concurrent access is
 *                 required, it is the caller's responsibility to protect access to this
 *                 object.
 *
 *  @tparam T           The data type that will be contained in the scratch buffer.  This
 *                      can be any primitive, struct, or class type.
 *  @tparam BaseSize_   The number of items of type @p T that can be held in the scratch
 *                      buffer's stack array without needing to allocate from the heap.
 *                      This is guaranteed to be at least 16 items.
 *  @tparam ShrinkThreshold_    The threshold expressed as a percentage of the buffer's
 *                              previous size below which the buffer itself will be shrunken
 *                              on a resize operation that makes it smaller.  If the new
 *                              size of the buffer expressed as a percentage of the old size
 *                              is larger than this number, the previous buffer will be
 *                              kept instead of allocating and copying a new one.  This is
 *                              done as a performance optimization for callers that need
 *                              to grow and shrink their buffer frequently, but don't
 *                              necessarily want to incur the overhead of an allocation
 *                              and copy each time.  For example, if the threshold is 25%
 *                              and the buffer is resized from 20 items to 6, a reallocation
 *                              will not occur since the new size is 30% of the previous.
 *                              By contrast, if it is resized to 4 items from 20, a reallocation
 *                              will occur since the new size is 20% of the previous.  By default
 *                              the buffer will only grow and never shrink regardless of the
 *                              size and number of resize requests.
