// TL;DR: Gymnastics to get around SIOF (Static Initialization Order Fiasco) with supported compilers
//
// For GCC this is pretty easy. The init_priority attribute allows us to specify a priority value to use for
// initialization order. For recursive_shared_mutex's lockList, we really only care that it's constructed before
// application initializers run.
//
// We have to jump through some hoops here for MSVC since this is a header-only class. MSVC does have pragma init_seg,
// BUT a given translation unit (i.e. cpp files) may have only one. Since this exists as a header-only class and we
// don't want to force linkage of a cpp file specifically for this, we can get around it by injecting our initializer
// function into the appropriate segment for initializer order at link time.
//
// This is a fairly good reference for the various C-Runtime initializer sections:
// https://gist.github.com/vaualbus/622099d88334fbba1d4ae703642c2956
//
// #pragma init_seg(lib) corresponds to section .CRT$XCL (the L seems to indicate `lib`). Ironically, C=compiler,
// L=lib, and U=user are also in alphabetical order and make nice delimiters between .CRT$XCA (__xc_a) and .CRT$XCZ
// (__xc_z).
#    if CARB_COMPILER_MSC

// If we just specified a variable of type carb::thread::ThreadLocal<LockList> (even allocating it into a specific
// custom section) the compiler will still try to instantiate it during the init_seg(user) order. To circumvent this
// behavior, we instead contain this variable inside `DataContainer`, but are careful to have the DataContainer()
// constructor well defined with zero side-effects. This is because constructLockList() will be called first (during the
// compiler's init_seg(lib) initialization order), which will construct the tls member inside of DataContainer, but the
// DataContainer() constructor for lockListData runs after (during the compiler's init_seg(user) initialization order).

/**
 * A recursive shared mutex. Similar to `std::shared_mutex` or carb::thread::shared_mutex, but can be used recursively.
 *
 * This primitive supports lock conversion: If a thread already holds one or more shared locks and attempts to take an
 * exclusive lock, the shared locks are released and the same number of exclusive locks are added. However, this is not
 * done atomically. @see recursive_shared_mutex::lock() for more info.
 *
 * A single thread-local storage entry is used to track the list of recursive_shared_mutex objects that a thread has
 * locked and their recursive lock depth. However, as this is a header-only class, all modules that use this class will
 * allocate their own thread-local storage entry.
