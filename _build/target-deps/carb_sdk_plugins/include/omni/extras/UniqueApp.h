/** Helper class to manage a unique app.  A unique app is one that is intended to only
 *  run a single instance of it at any given time.  This contains helper functions to handle
 *  common tasks that are intended to be used on both the unique app's side and on the host
 *  app side.  This contains two major sets of helper functions.
 *    * One set is to manage the uniqueness of the app itself.  These can either be called
 *      entirely from within the unique app process after launch to determine if another
 *      instance of the app is already running and that the new one should exit immediately.
 *      Alternatively, the launching host app could also first check if the unique app process
 *      is already running before deciding to launch it in the first place.
 *    * The other set is to manage notifying the unique app process when it should exit
 *      naturally.  These functions setup a signal that a host app is still running that
 *      the unique app can then poll on.  The host app is responsible for setting its
 *      'running' signal early on its launch.  The unique app process will then periodically
 *      poll to see if any host apps are still running.
 *
 *  Note that a 'connection' to the unique app is not actually a connection in a communication
 *  sense.  This is more akin to a reference count on an object that the operating system will
 *  manage regardless of how the host app exits or stops running.  The 'connection' can exist
 *  for the host app before the unique app is even launched (in fact, this behaviour is preferred
 *  since it simplifies polling and avoids the possibility of an unintentional early exit).
 *  The host app's 'connection' to the unique app does not require any actual communication, just
 *  that the connection object remain open until it is either explicitly closed or the host app
 *  process exits.
