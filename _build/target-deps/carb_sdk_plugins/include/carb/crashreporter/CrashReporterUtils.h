 *           current values in the `/crashreporter/` branch of the settings registry.
 *           If the ISettings interface is not available, the crash reporter will only
 *           use its default settings and many features will be disabled.  In this case
 *           the disabled features will include monitoring for changes to the various
 *           `/crashreporter/` settings, specifying metadata to include in crash reports,
 *           and controlling how and where the crash dump files are written out.
 *
 *  @note When the process is shutting down, the crash reporter should be disabled
 *        by calling @ref carb::crashreporter::deregisterCrashReporterForClient().
 *        It is the host app's responsibility to properly disable the crash reporter
 *        before the plugin is unloaded.
 *
 *  @thread_safety This operation is not thread safe.  It is the caller's responsibility
 *                 to ensure this is only called from a single thread at any given time.
 *                 However, this will be automatically called during Carbonite framework
 *                 startup (in carb::startupFramework()) and does not necessarily need
 *                 to be called directly.

/** Attempts to upload any crash dump files left by a previously crashed process.

 *  @returns A future that can be used to check on the completion of the upload operation.
 *           The operation is fully asynchronous and will proceed on its own.  The future
 *           object will be signaled once the operation completes, successfully or otherwise.
 *
 *  @remarks This starts off the process of checking for and uploading old crash dump files
 *           that may have been left over by a previous crashed process.  This situation can
 *           occur if the upload failed in the previous process (ie: network connection
 *           issue, etc), or the process crashed again during the upload.  A list of old
 *           crash dump files will be searched for in the currently set dump directory
 *           (as set by `/crashreporter/dumpDir`).  If any are found, they will be uploaded
 *           one by one to the currently set upload URL (`/crashreporter/url`).  Each
 *           crash dump file will be uploaded with its original metadata if the matching
 *           metadata file can be found.  Once a file has been successfully uploaded to
 *           the given upload URL, it will be deleted from local storage unless the
 *           `/crashreporter/preserveDump` setting is `true`.  This entire process will
 *           be skipped if the `/crashreporter/skipOldDumpUpload` setting is `true` and
 *           this call will simply return immediately.
 *
 *  @thread_safety This function is thread safe.  If multiple calls are made while an upload
 *                 is still in progress, a new task will just be added to the upload queue
 *                 instead of starting off another upload thread.
 *
 *  @note If an upload is in progress when the process tries to exit or the crash reporter
 *        plugin tries to unload, any remaining uploads will be cancelled, but the current
 *        upload operation will wait to complete.  If this is a large file being uploaded
 *        or the internet connection's upload speed is particularly slow, this could potentially
 *        take a long time.  There is unfortunately no reliable way to cancel this upload
 *        in progress currently.

/** Adds a metadata value to the crash reporter.
 *
 *  @tparam T           The type of the value to set.  This may be any value type that is
 *                      compatible with @a std::to_string().
 *  @param[in] keyName  The name of the metadata key to set.  This must only contain printable
 *                      ASCII characters except for a double quote ('"'), slash ('/'), or
 *                      whitespace.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure the key name
 *                      will not be overwriting another system's metadata value.  One way to
 *                      do this is to prefix the key name with the name of the extension or
 *                      plugin (sanitized to follow the above formatting rules).
 *  @param[in] value    The value to add to the crash reporter's metadata table.  This may be
 *                      any string that is accepted by carb::settings::ISettings::setString()
 *                      as a new value.  Note that this will remove the metadata value if it is
 *                      set to `nullptr` or an empty string.
 *  @returns `true` if the new metadata value is successfully set.  Returns `false` otherwise.
 *
 *  @remarks This adds a new metadata value to the crash reporter.  When a crash occurs, all
 *           values added through here will be collected and transmitted as metadata to
 *           accompany the crash report.  The metadata value will value will be added (or
 *           updated) to the crash reporter by adding (or updating) a key under the
 *           "/crashreporter/data/" settings branch.
 *
 *  @note This should not be called frequently to update the value of a piece of metadata.
 *        Doing so will be likely to incur a performance hit since the crash reporter watches
 *        for changes on the "/crashreporter/data/" settings branch that is modified here.
 *        Each time the branch changes, the crash reporter's metadata list is updated.  If
 *        possible, the value for any given piece of metadata should only be updated when
 *        it either changes or just set once on startup and left alone.

 *
 *  @param[in] keyName  The name of the key to give to the file.  This is what the file will be
 *                      uploaded as.  Using the file's original name should be fine in most
 *                      cases, however it should not contain characters such as '/' or '\'
 *                      at the very least.  Non-ASCII characters should be avoided if possible
 *                      too.  It is the caller's responsibility to ensure adding this new file
 *                      will not overwrite another upload file with the same key name.  This
 *                      may not use the reserved name 'upload_file_minidump'.  This key name
 *                      string will always be sanitized to only contain database friendly
 *                      characters.  All invalid characters will be replaced by an underscore
 *                      ('_').
 *  @param[in] filename The full path to the file to upload.  This may be a relative or absolute
 *                      path.  The file may or may not exist at the time of this call, it will
 *                      still be added to the list of files to be uploaded.  If the file does not
 *                      exist at the time of the crash, it will be filtered out of the list at
 *                      that point.  A warnings message will be written out for each listed file
 *                      that is missing at the time of the crash however.
 *  @returns `true` if the new entry is added to the list.  Returns `false` if the file could
 *           not be added.  This failure will only occur if the `ISettings` interface is not
 *           available.  Note that a `true` return does not necessarily mean that the new file
 *           was fully added to the list.  It would have been written to the list in the settings
 *           registry, but may have been ignored by the crash reporter if the same key was given
 *           as a previous file.
 *
 *  @remarks This adds a filename to be tracked to upload with the next crash report that is
 *           generated.  This setting is not persistent across sessions.  If no crash occurs,
 *           the file will not be uploaded anywhere.  This cannot be used to rename a file that
 *           has already been added to the upload list (ie: change the filename under an existing
 *           key).  If a second filename is specified with the same key, it will be ignored.
 *
 *  @note Extra files added with this function will not be deleted once a crash report is
 *        successfully uploaded.  Only the crash report's main dump file and metadata files
 *        will be deleted in this case.
