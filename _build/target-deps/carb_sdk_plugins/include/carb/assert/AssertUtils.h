/** Sets whether the software breakpoint for a failed assertion should be triggered.
 *
 *  @param[in] enabled  Set to `true` to trigger the software breakpoint when an assertion fails.
 *                      Set to `false` to skip over the software breakpoint and just continue
 *                      execution when an assertion fails.  The default behaviour is to always
 *                      trigger the software breakpoint unless it is overridden by user input
 *                      on the assertion dialog (if enabled).

 *           were previously enabled; `false` if breakpoints were previously disabled.
 *
 *  @remarks This sets whether the software breakpoint for failed assertions should be triggered.
 *           This can be used to allow failed assertions to just continue execution instead of
 *           hitting the software breakpoint.  The assertion failure message is always still
 *           written to the log destinations.  This is useful for checking whether certain 'safe'
 *           assertions failed during execution - allow them to continue execution as normal,
 *           then periodically check the assertion failure count with getFailureCount().
 *           Note that this still won't prevent a crash after a 'fatal' assertion fails.
